the sonar project:
    - the sonar project will need to be polished, commented, documented, sorted.
    - the document will contain:
        - a brief overview of what the project is
        - an explnation on how to play the game
        - any problems that popped up and the solutions do them
        - a explnation on some of the game mechanics such as:
            - sonar particals
            - the movement
    
    - the polish:
        - the game will not have memory leaks
            - can test this using task manager and see if the mem usage goes up over time
        - the game mechanics must be consistant and not buggy
        - it has to run at a reasonable frame rate 
            - above 20
        - it has to be easy to understand what to do 
            - key bindings the top - stating what ovjective

    - the sonar will be done up like a game that will include the following:
        - a game level selection ( min of 2 levels ) 
            - ( changed ) just one map will do so no need for a selection
        - goal
            - shoot at a target. that will show up as a different color on the sonar
        - score system 
            - you have to distroy as many targets in a time limit.
        - finish condition
         - when the timer runs out
        - fail condition
         - hit the enemy
        - continuios movement (like how a boat dosent just stop when it turns its motors off) ( bonus )
        - an enemy (bonus)
